# multiplayer-jezzball-cs2500a
N-player JezzBall with functionality for one or 'n' number of players.

Created this game over two weeks (Nov 2021) in Fundamentals of Computer Science I at Northeastern University.
I worked with my pair programming partner to write, design, and test the methods, game logic, and game rendering.

'boxout_server.rkt' was provided to us by the professor and aided in the process of linking the games from remote computers.
I have no idea if Lerner keeps up that server outside of this couple of weeks, so it may not work as expected from remote computers.
